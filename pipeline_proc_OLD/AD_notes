AD notes:
Information about setting up control logic from a TT (appendix D from text, which is not in the print book): 
https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/470/Appendix-D.pdf

I recommend we leave the control logic until last and then go through it.

Appendix A has all of the opcodes spelled out for each of the instructions we need to implement.

Figure 4.12 on p. 260 has a table with the control signals for most of the instructions we need, but some are missing.

p. 253 has the diagram of the registers.
Do we need to declare the clock as a register in Verilog?

Pieces we have:
Sign extender (done and checked)
Single register (done and checked)
ALU (badly documented one from class; also handles the addition for the PC, etc)
Mux
RAM (SRAM? DRAM?)
D-flip-flops


What we need to make:
PC (just a single register)
Register file (schematic on B-55, in progress)
Data memory (from RAM)
Instruction memory (from RAM)
Control Circuit (recommend we do last)

MIPS register file convention is on p. 105 in text
The PC is just a register, and we have a working version.
